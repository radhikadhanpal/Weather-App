# Weather App


I created a weather web app using JavaScript and a weather API. The purpose of this software is to provide users with current weather information for a given location.

To start a test server on your computer and view the first page of the app, follow these steps:

Make sure you have a web server installed on your computer. One popular option is to use Node.js with the http-server package. If you don't have Node.js installed, you can download it from the official website (https://nodejs.org) and follow the installation instructions.

Open your command-line interface (e.g., Terminal on macOS or Command Prompt on Windows).

Navigate to the directory where your weather app files are located using the cd command. For example, if your app files are in a folder called "weather-app," you can use the command cd path/to/weather-app to navigate into that directory.

Once you're in the correct directory, start the test server by running the following command:


http-server

The server will start, and it will display the local IP address and port where your app is being served. It might look something like this:


Starting up http-server, serving ./ on: http://192.168.1.100:8080

Open a web browser and enter the URL provided by the server (e.g., http://192.168.1.100:8080) in the address bar.

The web browser will load the first page of your weather app, where users can enter a location or allow the app to access their current location (depending on the app's functionality).

Once the webpage loads, users will be able to interact with your weather app to view current weather information for the specified location.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running (starting the server and navigating through the web pages) and a walkthrough of the code.}
